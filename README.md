# Blender Proc2
A procedural Blender pipeline for photorealistic rendering.


BlenderProc is a modular procedural pipeline, which helps generate real-looking images for the training of convolutional neural networks. 
These can be used in various use cases including segmentation, depth, normal and pose estimation and many others. 
A key feature of our extension of Blender is the simple-to-use modular pipeline, which was designed to be easily extendable. 
By offering standard modules, that cover a variety of scenarios, we provide a starting point on which new modules can be created.

# Colab Integration

The project includes a Google Colab file (colab_example.ipynb) that demonstrates the generation of color outputs using BlenderProc2. This Colab notebook allows users to interactively work with the procedural pipeline, generate color outputs, and download 3D OBJ files directly to their local machine for visualization.

# To run the Colab notebook:

Open the Colab file available at examples/basics/basic in Google Colab.

Execute the cells in the notebook to generate colour outputs.

Download the generated 3D OBJ files from the Colab environment to your local machine.
